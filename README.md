# User Management Dashboard

## Overview

The User Management Dashboard is a React application that allows users to manage a list of users. Users can view, create, update, and delete user information. The application fetches user data from an external API and provides a user-friendly interface for managing users.

## Features

- View a list of users with details including name, email, phone, and status.
- Add new users using a user-friendly form.
- Edit existing user details.
- Delete users with a confirmation prompt.
- Search and filter users based on name and status.
- Pagination to navigate through users easily.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- **React Router**: For client-side routing.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.

## Getting Started

To run this application locally, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- npm (Node package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Siddarthprasanna/infotura-assignment-siddarth.git
   cd user-management-dashboard
Install the dependencies:

Start the application:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

API Integration
The application fetches user data from the following API:

JSONPlaceholder Users API
Error Handling
The application includes error handling to manage potential issues with fetching data from the API. A loading state is displayed while the data is being fetched.

Deployment
The application is deployed and can be accessed at:
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
